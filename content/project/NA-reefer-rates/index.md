title: "In-Depth Visualization of North-American Reefer Transportation Rates in Tableau"
summary: "Compared Rich Products' negotiated reefer transportation rates to data provided by three major data providers: DAT, Chainalytics and Data Services (powered by Llamasoft). Created dashboards in Tableau to represent lanes where Rich's could save money on transportation costs, and where it was much cheaper than the market for Spot and Contract rates. Savings recommended had a potential to save Rich's over $100k in transportation costs."
