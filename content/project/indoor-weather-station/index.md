title: "Indoor Weather Station"
summary: "This was my first project before foraying into the world of home automation. Started with a DHT22 wired up to a flashed ESP8266 board, which then connected to a node.js server, running on a local Raspberry, and avaiable to Siri and Alexa. Upgraded later to use BME280 sensor (with the same ESP8266 board) and paired with Home Assistant."
