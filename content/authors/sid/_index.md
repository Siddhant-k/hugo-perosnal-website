bio: I love tinkering hardware and automating hardware and software. Frank Lloyd Wright once said, ‚ÄúIf automation keeps up, man will atrophy all his limbs but the push-button finger‚Äù ‚Äì‚Äì I envision an automated & integrated future, where machines and tech blend *seamlessly* into our daily lives.

interests:
- Linux ‚Äì I currently run a home-lab with over 15 docker containers and two domains served over Cloudflare CDNs to host the on-prem services.
- Hardware ‚Äì I am into the IoT world; I run my on-prem Home Assistant home automation solution. I have also completed some academic research into LoRaWAN and I found it super exciting for IoT applications!

[Hello there](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hello-there)! I am **Sid**, an **Electrical Engineering B.Sc.** graduate from [**University at Buffalo**](https://www.seas.buffalo.edu) in New York, with a minor in **Mathematics**. I have since moved to [Toronto, Ontario üá®üá¶](https://www.toronto.ca) (It's a beautiful city!). I expect to get my [Engineer-in-Training](https://www.peo.on.ca/engineering-intern-program) license from [Professional Engineers Ontario](https://www.peo.on.ca) by January 2021.

## ABOUT ME

I currently work at **Acculogic** as an Electrical Application and Support Engineer. Acculogic manufactures flying probe testers and develops testing applications for companies. Clients I work with include top US Defence companies along-with many other Fortune 500 companies.

Previously, I have interned at **Rich Products**, a global food company, where I was part of the **Optimization** team, and worked on **extracting savings within the production and the transportation network** using ETL tools. I also interned at **University at Buffalo Information Technology** where I was part of a team that **developed a fully customizable smart Crestron experience**. I led Linux programming, Raspberry Pi, Identification and Amazon Web Services (AWS) piece of the project.
Other than that, I have I have independently managed the SQL dB and the application front-end to over 300 users, developed Excel macros to eliminate most repetitive tasks, managed scripting & advanced functions of over 20 Google Sheets for employee management and record-keeping and developed a new data analytics platform to analyze over 18 million print jobs per year and achieved 100% accuracy.

On a more casual note, I like reading (non-fiction), watching soccer, and traveling. I like to call myself a *beta tester* because I like to dive in to challenges.
