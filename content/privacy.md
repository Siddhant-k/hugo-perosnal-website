## Personal Information

I collect absolutely nothing. Any data you enter on my website (even on the contact form) is not viewable by anyone other than yourself until you submit it. Although your contact info will only stay in my email, I can delete it upon request.

## Analytics

I used to use Google Analytics (because it was free and easy to setup!), but I have since #degoogled. Google Analytics drops cookies on your machine. Along-with other tracking methods, Google builds a profile about you and monetizes it â€“ as a privacy focused person myself, that was not acceptable to me.

I now use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) (open source, cloud instance) and [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee) (open source, on-prem in Docker) to get basic analytics about the visitors of my website. These do not identify you in any way and _respect your privacy_.

## Get in touch

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://siddhantkhera.ca/#contact)!
